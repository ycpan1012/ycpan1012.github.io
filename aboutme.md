Hi, this is Yun-Chung (George). I am from Taiwan and currently studying computational informatics and chemical engineering at [Cornell](https://www.cornell.edu/). Before that I graduated from [NTUT](https://www-en.ntut.edu.tw/) with a bachelor degree in chemical engineering and biotechnology. I am passionate about workout, music (especially K-pop!), billiards, and data science! Being a data scientist allows me to keep exploring science in the most fashionable way.

### My short story...

After conducting several chemical and bioresearch, I clearly understand that we can find the truth only if we possess the power of data science. My undergrad project was focused on molecular simulation and optimization, and at that time my daily task was to use software to generate data that illustrate the properties and attributes of compounds or chemical reactions. However, without the knowledge of statistics and skills in using computational for data analysis, the true fact will still be left behind in the forest. I then self-learned Python and advanced statistics, and finally, those weapons help me find out an [efficient model](https://www.aiche.org/conferences/aiche-annual-meeting/2019/proceeding/paper/376bg-modelling-micellization-rhamnolipid-biosurfactant-mesoscale-simulation) that can simulate ionic surfactants with great accuracy but lower computational cost. This is how I started to love data science.
