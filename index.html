Hi, this is Yun-Chung (George). I am from Taiwan and currently studying computational informatics and chemical engineering at Cornell. Before that I graduated from NTUT with a bachelor degree in chemical engineering and biotechnology. I am passionate about <strong>workout</strong>, <strong>music</strong> (especially K-pop!), <strong>billiards</strong>, and <strong>data science</strong>! Being a data scientist allows me to keep exploring science in the most fashionable way.
