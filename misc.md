### Vice Director, NTUT Student Association
I Organized and hosted a school orientation for 60+ incoming students and advised on course and major selection.

### Leader, NTUT Service-Learning Club, Taipei, Taiwan Feb 2016 - Jun 2016
I led a team of 8 tutors in a charity that helped provide educational resources for students from remote areas. I paired students with tutors based on their personalities, and also organized several brainstorming sessions for our tutor team to design an interesting and creative curriculum that successfully motivated our students to learn subjects from math to social science.
